Some useful scripts, some of them are still very much in progress and should be read carefully 
before using it on your system

#### backup.sh (WIP)
I use that script to backup my home directory to my Backup VM, which has been very useful so far.
I will probably add more features in the future as my backup needs. 

#### debinst.sh (WIP)
An untested script to customise a newly installed Debian system.
I commented every packages inclusion in there because I felt like doing that..

#### diary
Found this little gem and polished it. 
As you can probably figure out by its name, it's a simple diary application.

#### xsetcmus.sh
Prints out the song's title and the duration, to be displayed on DWM statusbar
